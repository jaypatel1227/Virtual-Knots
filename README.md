##### Virtual-Knots

This is some quickly thrown together code that draws the gauss diagram of the virtual knot corresponding to the relations of a given group that is in Wirtinger presentation.

The algorithm was gotten from Se-Goo Kim's paper on this subject. Here is the link to the [Paper.](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9907172)

I will not stand by the quality of this code as I just tossed it together in a short period of time and have not revisited it since. Perhaps, I will revisit it at some time.
